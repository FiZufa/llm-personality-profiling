      "The text critiques the reliance on celebrity opinions as a basis for truth, explicitly labeling it a \"logical fallacy.\" This reflects a strong emphasis on **critical analysis** and **impersonal logic** (dominant **Introverted Intuition [Ni]** and auxiliary **Extraverted Thinking [Te]**), key traits of the INTJ type.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Focus on Logical Structure (Te):**  \n",
      "   The statement directly dismantles an argument by identifying a fallacy (appeal to authority), prioritizing objective reasoning over emotional or social validation. This aligns with Te, which seeks efficiency, correctness, and systematic critique.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Skepticism and Pattern Recognition (Ni):**  \n",
      "   The critique implies an ability to discern underlying flaws in reasoning (Ni’s focus on abstract patterns). INTJs often anticipate weaknesses in arguments and prioritize principles over popular opinion, as seen here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Contrast with Other Types:**  \n",
      "   - **INTP** might dissect the fallacy in more detail (Ti), but the text’s concise, decisive tone leans toward Te’s action-oriented critique.  \n",
      "   - **ENTP** would likely explore the idea playfully or hypothetically, whereas this text is blunt and final, characteristic of INTJ’s strategic, results-driven mindset.  \n",

The speaker questions the underlying purpose of the rant, prioritizing objective analysis over emotional validation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exploration of Possibilities (Ne):** The phrase *“I don’t know if it’s just a rant or you actually want to do something”* highlights **extraverted Intuition (Ne)**, which generates multiple interpretations and considers hypothetical scenarios. ENTPs often engage in this type of speculative reasoning, probing for deeper meaning or hidden agendas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Generalization Based on Observation (Si):** The statement *“most people just want to rant”* suggests reliance on past observations or patterns (tertiary **introverted Sensing [Si]**).

      "1. **Extraverted Intuition (Ne)**:  \n",
      "   - The phrase \"could also be a sign\" reflects a willingness to explore alternative explanations or possibilities. ENTPs thrive on generating hypotheses and considering multiple angles, which aligns with the speculative and open-ended nature of the statement.  \n",

      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**  \n",
      "1. **Introverted Feeling (Fi) Dominant:** The text reflects a strong internal value system. The decision to delete the post stems from personal disappointment that the conversation did not align with their expectations or values. INFPs prioritize authenticity and often withdraw or disengage when their contributions feel misaligned with their ideals. The phrase “I thought this conversation was going to go a completely different direction” suggests an internalized vision (Fi) of how the interaction *should* have unfolded, which contrasts with reality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Intuition (N) over Sensing (S):** The focus on the “direction” of the conversation implies an abstract, future-oriented perspective (Ni/Ne). INFPs often rely on intuition to anticipate outcomes or patterns, and the frustration here arises from a mismatch between their envisioned trajectory (Ne exploration of possibilities) and the actual course of the discussion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perceiving (P) Tendencies:** While the text does not explicitly emphasize spontaneity, the reactive deletion of the post (rather than organizing or redirecting the conversation) aligns with Perceiving traits. INFPs may disengage fluidly when their ideals are unmet, preferring to avoid rigid structures that clash with their internal values.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comparison to Examples:**  \n",
      "   - Similar to **Example 28 (INFP)**, where the user withdraws (“never looks at this thread again”), this text shows a retreat based on personal dissatisfaction.  \n",

      "1. **Introversion (I):** The focus on internal, subjective experiences (dreams) points to introversion.  \n",
      "2. **Intuition (N):** Tornadoes are symbolic (chaos, unresolved emotions) rather than literal, aligning with abstract, pattern-oriented intuition (Ni).  \n",
      "3. **Feeling (F):** The emotional undertones (tornadoes as turmoil, relationships with coworkers/family) highlight a focus on interpersonal dynamics and harmony, indicative of **Fe** (Extraverted Feeling), which INFJs use as their auxiliary function.  \n",
      "4. **Judging (J):** The structured mention of \"business\" trips and recurring themes hint at a subconscious desire for resolution or order, consistent with INFJ’s tertiary **Ti** (Introverted Thinking) seeking internal coherence.  \n",

      "INFJs often process subconscious material (Ni) to understand relationships (Fe) and resolve emotional complexity.

      "1. **Dominant Fi (Introverted Feeling):** The text centers on intense personal emotions (\"i have anxiety\") and internal turmoil, characteristic of dominant Fi. INFPs prioritize authentic emotional experiences and often introspect deeply about their feelings, which aligns with the self-focused expression of anxiety here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Auxiliary Ne (Extraverted Intuition):** The metaphor \"moments are like a time bomb ticks for me\" suggests a tendency to perceive abstract, future-oriented threats (Ne). INFPs use Ne to explore possibilities, but when stressed, this can manifest as overthinking potential negative outcomes, akin to a \"time bomb\" of accumulating worries.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stress and Overwhelm:** The phrase \"cannot keep count of those [moments]\" reflects a struggle to manage sensory or practical details (inferior Sensing, Si), which is common for INFPs under stress. The focus on internal chaos rather than external solutions further supports Fi dominance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Metaphorical Language:** INFPs often use vivid, symbolic language to articulate emotions (e.g., \"time bomb\"), as seen in other INFP examples (e.g., Example 30’s artistic reflection). This contrasts with types like ISTJ or ISTP, which prioritize concrete details.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Sensing (S):** The focus is on practical, immediate concerns (\"start enforcing this\") rather than abstract or future-oriented ideas.

      "\n",
      "3. **Thinking (T):** The decision to \"enforce\" boundaries is framed as a logical response to a problem (being overwhelmed by social pressure). This reflects a preference for objective, impersonal decision-making (T) over harmony-driven considerations (F). The emphasis is on efficiency and self-preservation rather than accommodating others’ feelings.  \n",

      "4. **Contrast with Other Types**:  \n",

      "1. **Extraverted Intuition (Ne):**  \n",

      "   - While ENFPs are outwardly adaptable, their Fi drives them to align these adaptations with their core values. The distinction that these shifts are \"not like bipolar sides\" suggests a conscious, values-driven flexibility (Fi) rather than instability.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perceiving (P) Preference:**  \n",

      "1. **Focus on Thinking (T) over Feeling (F):** The text explicitly dismisses \"charming\" (a trait often linked to Fe/Extraverted Feeling, which prioritizes social harmony and likability) and instead emphasizes logical, results-oriented qualities like \"highly intelligent,\" \"decisive,\" and \"direct.\" This aligns with Te (Extraverted Thinking), which values efficiency, objective analysis, and decisive action.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Judging (J) Orientation:** The emphasis on \"decisive\" and \"direct\" traits points to a preference for structure, clarity, and goal-oriented behavior (Judging). ENTJs, as Te-dominant types, excel at organizing systems and making authoritative decisions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Persuasion as Strategic Influence:** While \"persuasive\" could hint at Fe, the context frames it as a tool for effectiveness rather than emotional appeal. ENTJs use their auxiliary Ni (Introverted Intuition) to strategize and persuade others through visionary logic, aligning with the text’s admiration for intelligence and decisiveness.  \n",

      "4. **Contrast with Examples:** The text mirrors Example 7 (ENTJ: \"force-fed her pedialyte\") and Example 8 (ENTJ: \"highly efficient machine\"), where Te-driven problem-solving and organizational prowess dominate. The dismissal of charm for utilitarian strengths further distances the type from Fe-heavy types like ENFJ or ESFJ.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tertiary Se and Fi:** ENTJs’ tertiary Se (Extraverted Sensing) supports their directness and action-oriented approach, while inferior Fi (Introverted Feeling) explains the minimal focus on emotional validation (\"sorry just no\" reflects blunt honesty over diplomacy).  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Feeling (F) over Thinking (T):** The reluctance to discuss their \"unpretty side\" suggests a strong **Introverted Feeling (Fi)** function.

While ESFPs are outwardly social (Se), their auxiliary Fi makes them selective about sharing deeper emotions or insecurities.  \n",

      "**Reasoning:**  \n",
      "The text emphasizes a preference for remaining \"factual and objective,\" which strongly aligns with **Introverted Thinking (Ti)**, the dominant function of INTPs. Ti focuses on internal logical analysis, prioritizing accuracy over personal opinions or social harmony. The individual's indifference toward asserting their views (\"don't wear my opinions on my sleeve\") suggests a detachment from **Extraverted Feeling (Fe)** (their inferior function), which often manifests as ambivalence toward external emotional dynamics.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While the person finds discussions \"entertaining and educational,\" they clarify that this isn’t a primary goal. This reflects **Extraverted Intuition (Ne)** (their auxiliary function), which explores ideas and possibilities but doesn’t prioritize them as a core focus. INTPs often engage with abstract concepts casually rather than seeking structured debates (unlike ENTPs, who actively pursue intellectual sparring).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of interest in \"goals\" or persuasion aligns with a **Perceiving (P)** preference, favoring open-ended exploration over decisive conclusions. ISTPs (also Ti-dominant) might share this logical detachment but would likely emphasize practical, present-focused engagement (via **Se**), whereas the text’s abstract, idea-oriented tone better suits INTP’s **Ne**.  \n",

      "**MBTI Type Prediction:** ESFP\n",

      "**Reasoning:**  \n",
      "1. **Extraverted Sensing (Se) Dominant:** The text emphasizes a hands-on, present-moment activity (\"bottle flipping\") and a focus on immediate sensory experiences. The excitement of landing the bottle and the physical reaction from friends (\"oohhhhhhh\") highlight a strong engagement with the external environment, a hallmark of Se. ESFPs prioritize spontaneity and thrive in lively, interactive settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Social and Energetic:** The activity was done with a \"group of friends,\" indicating extraversion and a preference for social interaction. ESFPs are often described as \"entertainers\" who enjoy being the center of attention, and the validation from peers (\"all my friends were like oohhhhhhh\") aligns with their desire for social approval and shared enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Playful and Spontaneous:** Bottle-flipping is a lighthearted, impulsive activity, reflecting the ESFP’s preference for fun, flexibility, and living in the moment. This contrasts with types that prioritize planning (Judging types like ESTJ) or abstract analysis (Intuitive types like ENTP).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Tertiary Extraverted Feeling (Fe):** While ESFPs lead with Se, their tertiary Fe drives them to connect with others emotionally. The shared excitement and group reaction suggest a desire to harmonize with and entertain their social circle, reinforcing the ESFP’s people-oriented nature.\n",

      "   - Unlike ENFJs (who might emphasize abstract ideals or future-oriented solutions), the text is grounded in immediate, practical interaction.  \n",
      "   - The absence of Ne (exploring possibilities) or Ti (internal logic) dominance rules out ENTP/INTP. Similarly, the focus on others’ needs over personal values (Fi) excludes Fi-dominant types like INFP/ISFP.  \n",

      "The text \"i used to be like that when i was younger but now it choose when to show it\" highlights a shift from unrestrained behavior to deliberate control over self-expression. This reflects **Extraverted Feeling (Fe)**, which prioritizes social harmony and adaptability.

      "1. **Future-Oriented Focus (Ni Dominant):** The text emphasizes living for the future and constantly planning an idealized version of it. This aligns with **Introverted Intuition (Ni)**, a dominant function of INTJ and INFJ types. Ni users are driven by long-term visions and strategic foresight, often feeling disconnected from the present if it conflicts with their aspirations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dissatisfaction with the Present (Ni-Fi Interaction):** The phrase \"deeply unhappy about my current life\" suggests a tension between the individual’s internal values (Fi, tertiary in INTJ) and their current reality. INTJs, while primarily analytical (Te), often have strong personal ideals (Fi) and may feel frustrated when their environment fails to meet their high standards or long-term goals.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Structured Planning (Judging Preference):** The emphasis on \"constantly planning\" reflects a Judging (J) preference, characteristic of INTJs, who rely on **Extraverted Thinking (Te)** to organize and execute strategies. This contrasts with INFJs, who prioritize harmony (Fe) and may frame future plans in terms of collective or relational goals (absent here).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lack of External Focus (No Fe/Te Explicitly):** Unlike INFJs, who often express concern for others’ well-being (Fe), the text is introspective and self-referential. The focus on personal fulfillment (\"everything *I* want\") aligns more with INTJ’s tertiary Fi, which prioritizes individual authenticity and internal values over external harmony.  \n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Skepticism and Open-Endedness (P):** The phrase \"partially conclude\" reflects a tentative stance, suggesting a preference for Perceiving (P). INTPs typically withhold definitive judgments, preferring to explore possibilities and remain open to new data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **NT (Intuitive-Thinking) Core:** The subject engages with abstract concepts (e.g., categorizing personality types) and critiques a generalized claim about NT women. This aligns with the NT temperament, which prioritizes logical coherence and theoretical frameworks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Introverted Thinking (Ti) Dominance:** INTPs lead with Ti, which dissects ideas internally for structural flaws. Here, the author deconstructs the assumption’s validity by highlighting methodological weaknesses (small sample size), a hallmark of Ti’s analytical rigor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Contrast with INTJ:** While INTJs (Ni-Te) might also critique flawed assumptions, they tend to assert conclusions more decisively.

      "\n",
      "1. **Introspection and Sensitivity (Fi Dominant):**  \n",
      "   - Phrases like \"soul-searching\" and the acknowledgment of needing professional help indicate a deep focus on internal emotions, values, and personal growth. INFPs prioritize authenticity and inner harmony, often turning inward to process feelings (dominant Introverted Feeling, Fi).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Openness to Growth (Auxiliary Ne):**  \n",
      "   - The tentative phrasing \"Perhaps I might\" and the willingness to explore solutions (e.g., \"talking to a professional\") align with the INFP’s auxiliary Extraverted Intuition (Ne), which seeks possibilities and alternative perspectives. This contrasts with rigid or decisive language seen in Judging (J) types.  \n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Avoidance of Bluntness/Conflict (Inferior Te):**  \n",
      "   - The polite, non-confrontational tone (\"Thank you\") and indirect phrasing (\"could help as well\") avoid assertiveness or criticism, typical of INFPs who may struggle with direct, impersonal logic (inferior Extraverted Thinking, Te).  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):**  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Feeling (F) vs. Thinking (T):**  \n",
      "   The accommodating tone (\"I don’t mind though\") reflects a focus on harmony and social expectations, hallmarks of **Feeling (F)**. ESFJs use **Fe** to navigate interpersonal dynamics effectively, even in obligatory settings.  \n",

      "4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):**  \n",

      "- **Dominant Fe (Extraverted Feeling):** The individual prioritizes social harmony and adapts to others’ needs, even in demanding environments.  \n",

      "The text emphasizes a pragmatic, results-oriented perspective, which strongly aligns with the ENTJ personality type. Here's the breakdown:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Te (Extraverted Thinking) Dominant:**  \n",
      "   - The focus on effectiveness (\"I don't think that rioting and property destruction is going to solve the problem\") reflects a Te-driven analysis. ENTJs prioritize logical efficiency and practical outcomes over emotional or chaotic approaches. They seek systemic solutions and dismiss counterproductive methods.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ni (Introverted Intuition) Auxiliary:**  \n",
      "   - The phrase \"find common ground\" hints at a strategic, big-picture perspective. ENTJs use Ni to anticipate long-term consequences and unify disparate ideas into cohesive plans. They reject impulsive actions (like rioting) in favor of calculated, goal-oriented strategies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Judging (J) Preference:**  \n",
      "   - The disapproval of disorder (\"rioting and property destruction\") aligns with a preference for structure, control, and organized problem-solving. ENTJs value societal order and often take leadership roles to enforce systems that work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contrast with Other Types:**  \n",
      "   - Unlike ENFPs or ENTPs (who might entertain unconventional tactics), ENTJs prioritize measurable results. The text lacks Fi (personal values) or Fe (group harmony) emphasis, ruling out F-types. The direct, assertive tone and focus on efficacy over emotion further differentiate ENTJ from types like INFJ or INTP.  \n",

      "1. **Dominant Function (Ne - Extraverted Intuition):**  \n",
      "   The text explores alternative possibilities (\"Maybe he’s simply not ready...\") and challenges assumptions about social behavior. This reflects Ne’s focus on generating hypotheses and considering multiple perspectives rather than accepting surface-level interpretations.  \n",

      "3. **Tertiary Function (Fe - Extraverted Feeling):**  \n",

The individual describes overthinking (potentially linked to introverted functions like **Introverted Intuition (Ni)** or **Introverted Thinking (Ti)**) when alone but actively resolves this by engaging with the external world (\"go out and do shit\").

Phrases like \"made my day unimaginably happy\" and the warm, appreciative tone highlight a strong Fe preference, which prioritizes social harmony and others' emotional states. ENFJs (Fe dominant) and ESFJs (Fe with auxiliary Si) both exhibit this, but the text lacks the concrete, tradition-oriented details typical of Si.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Social Engagement and Warmth:** The use of \"dear\" and \"sincerely\" reflects a structured, socially attuned communication style, aligning with Judging (J) types. ENFJs often blend warmth with strategic social awareness, as seen in Examples 1–3 (e.g., fostering positivity or advising others to seek help). The playful \"xd\" adds an expressive, enthusiastic flair, characteristic of Extraversion (E).  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intuition (N) Over Sensing (S):** While the message is concise, the appreciation for \"witty posts\" suggests valuing abstract qualities like creativity and humor (Ne or Ni). ENFJs (auxiliary Ni) focus on broader implications and connections, whereas ESFJs might emphasize specific, tangible acts of kindness. The text’s focus on emotional impact rather than sensory details leans toward Ni.  \n",

      "3. **Gut Feeling and Efficiency (Se-Ti Synergy):** The \"gut feeling\" about logical inconsistencies without conscious effort indicates a strong **Ti** working in tandem with **Extraverted Sensing (Se)**. ISTPs (Ti-Se-Ni-Fe) combine Ti’s internal logic with Se’s immediate awareness of the environment, allowing them to rapidly process and react to practical challenges. This contrasts with INTPs (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe), who might over-analyze possibilities (Ne) rather than trusting a visceral, action-oriented instinct.  \n",

This aligns with examples like #24 (\"keep a casual mentality\"), where ESTPs acknowledge social friction but maintain their approach.\n",

      "**MBTI Type Prediction:** INFP  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**  \n",
      "1. **Dominant Introverted Feeling (Fi):** The text centers on a deeply personal stance toward trust (\"i dont trust people at all\"), reflecting Fi’s focus on internal values, authenticity, and emotional guardedness. INFPs prioritize their inner moral compass and often withdraw when their values feel threatened or when they perceive insincerity. The distrust suggests a protective stance over their inner world, a hallmark of Fi.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Questioning Others’ Experiences:** The inquiry (\"was there any event... that made you cautious?\") aligns with INFP’s auxiliary Extraverted Intuition (Ne), which seeks to explore others’ perspectives and hypothetical scenarios. However, the conclusion remains rooted in personal skepticism rather than external validation, reinforcing Fi’s dominance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tone of Disillusionment:** Phrases like \"how easily do you trust people\" and \"assuming you are weary of people\" imply a history of disappointment or betrayal. INFPs often idealize relationships but become reserved or cynical when their ideals clash with reality, leading to guardedness.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contrast with Other Types:**  \n",
      "   - **ISTJ/ISTP:** While distrustful, these types would likely cite logical reasons (e.g., past evidence, inefficiency) rather than emotional caution.  \n",
      "   - **INTJ/INTP:** Distrust here would manifest as systemic skepticism or intellectual critique, not personal wariness.  \n",
      "   - **ISFJ:** Though cautious, ISFJs prioritize harmony (Fe) and are less likely to reject trust entirely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Alignment with INFP Examples:** The text mirrors Example 28-30 (INFP), which emphasize internal emotional processing, personal values, and sensitivity to relational dynamics. The focus on distrust as a protective mechanism for inner ideals strongly points to INFP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** The combination of Fi-driven skepticism, introspective questioning, and guarded idealism aligns most closely with INFP, a type often wary of superficial connections and deeply attuned to their internal values.\n",
