      "The text provided suggests traits commonly associated with the INTP personality type. Here is the breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Logical and Analytical Thinking**: The text discusses \"analyzing\" shapes and objects, which indicates a focus on logical structures and abstract thinking. This is a central characteristic of the INTP type, who are known for their strong logical and analytical abilities. They often approach problems through analysis and tend to think in terms of systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Abstract Concepts**: The mention of not being \"bound by languages\" implies a comfort with abstract, non-concrete concepts. INTPs are typically interested in ideas and theories and are more inclined towards abstract thinking rather than concrete or literal interpretations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Introverted Intuition and Thinking**: The text reflects an interest in internal processing and understanding the underlying logic of the external world, which aligns with INTPs who are dominant in introverted thinking (Ti) and are also strong in extroverted intuition (Ne).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Detachment from Language**: The detachment from language suggests an inclination towards universal, non-verbal forms of understanding, which again reflects the INTP’s preference for working with conceptual and theoretical systems rather than direct, verbal interactions often emphasized by extraverted types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the text points to someone who values and engages in deep, logical thought and abstract conceptualization, which is characteristic of the INTP type.\n",

      "MBTI Type Prediction: INTP\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The given text reflects several qualities commonly associated with the INTP personality type. INTPs are known for their logical thinking, analytical nature, and skepticism towards arguments that lack solid reasoning. They value truth and tend to analyze and question assertions, especially when those assertions rely on authority rather than evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text criticizes the idea of accepting beliefs as true just because celebrities endorse them, indicating a preference for logical consistency and an appeal to rational standards rather than social or emotional influences. This skepticism towards superficial authority or appeals to authority judgments is typical of the INTP's focus on impersonal logic and their interest in truth-seeking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, INTPs are less likely to be swayed by popularity or status, aligning with the text's focus on logical fallacies rather than socially driven conclusions. The concise and direct presentation of the argument reflects the introverted thinking (Ti) dominant function of INTPs. Overall, the INTP type is the best fit given the logical and independent thinking expressed in the text.\n",

      "Response: \n",
      "MBTI Type Prediction: INTP\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The text's brevity and focus on distinguishing between ranting and taking action suggest a personality inclined towards critical thinking and analysis, rather than emotional engagement. Here are some points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Analytical Nature**: The phrase \"most people just want to rant\" implies a level of observation and judgment about general human behavior. This analytical perspective is characteristic of Thinking (T) types, who often prioritize logic and truth over harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Questioning Tone**: The text starts with an admission of uncertainty (\"i dont know if...\"), which indicates a reflective and questioning mindset. This is often associated with Intuitive (N) types who enjoy exploring possibilities and meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Detachment from Emotional Content**: There is a certain emotional detachment in the statement. This distance is more typical of Introverted (I) types over Extroverted (E) types, who are generally more focused on personal experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Action vs. Complaining**: The emphasis on whether there is a desire to take action or just to complain displays an interest in practical outcomes, typical of Perceiving (P) types like INTPs. They often weigh options before making decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the combination of reflective questioning, logical analysis of human behavior, and detachment from emotional engagement aligns well with the INTP personality type.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Critical Tone:** The text has a critical tone as it talks about an ego \"allowed to grow unchecked,\" suggesting a level of detachment and objectivity often associated with INTJ types, who are known for their critical thinking and high standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lack of Emotional Language:** There is an absence of emotional or personal sentiment in the statement, indicating a preference for thinking (T) over feeling (F). This preference for logic and objectivity aligns more with the INTJ personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Judgmental Aspect:** The phrase \"sign of immaturity\" implies a judgmental assessment or evaluation of a situation, typical of Judging (J) types who prefer order, structure, and evaluating scenarios based on logical reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Independence in Thought:** The statement implies an individual who is comfortable with independent, detached observation of situations. INTJs are known for their independence in thought and not shying away from critiquing ideas or behaviors they find lacking.\n",

This reflects a typical INFP characteristic of being open to the fluid nature of relationships and focusing more on the experience and value of having known someone, rather than on specific results or expectations. INFPs often value deep, meaningful connections over superficial ones, and they are comfortable with the idea that relationships may evolve or change over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the text lacks a focus on external metrics or structured outcomes, which suggests a preference for intuitive and feeling functions over judging or thinking.

      "MBTI Type Prediction: INTP\n",

      "Reasoning: This text displays a few key elements that suggest an INTP personality type. INTPs are often characterized by their analytical approach, desire for meaningful conversations, and tendency to step back when things don't go as planned or don't meet their expectations. The statement \"well ill just delete this post\" indicates a willingness to retract their statement or contribution when it is not perceived as relevant or valuable, which aligns with the INTP's preference for logical consistency and relevance. Furthermore, the sentiment \"i thought this conversation was going to go a completely different direction\" suggests that the individual had anticipated a particular line of discourse and was perhaps disappointed or surprised by its deviation, demonstrating a more internal, conceptual expectation typical of INTPs. This reflects the intuitive (N) aspect of anticipating and valuing the concepts being discussed and the thinking (T) aspect of retracting when the logic or relevance does not hold. Additionally, INTPs can be reserved and might choose to disengage in situations that do not meet their intellectual or logical criteria, just as seen in the text.\n",

      "Reasoning: The text provided reflects a focus on dreams and imagination, indicated by the mention of having \"dreams of tornadoes\" and dreams involving \"old coworkers and family.\" This suggests an introspective and imaginative mindset, which is often associated with the INFP personality type. INFPs are typically characterized by their rich inner worlds and tendency to focus on personal values and emotions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the text lacks the structured, detail-oriented, or logical analysis that would be more typical for a Thinking type like INTJ or ISTJ. It also does not exhibit the extroverted engagement with the outside world one might expect from more extroverted types such as ENFP or ESFP. Instead, the focus on dreams and personal experiences aligns with the inward focus and depth of feeling common in INFPs. Additionally, the mention of family and coworkers in dreams may point to significant personal relationships, which are important for Feeling types who value connections with others. This, combined with the abstract and reflective nature of the dreams, aligns well with the INFP profile.\n",

The mention of \"those moments are like a time bomb ticks for me\" and \"i have anxiety\" suggests an internalized perception of personal experiences and struggles with emotions and anxiety.

ISTJs are known for their practicality, discipline, and strong sense of duty. They often prefer structured environments and are focused on managing their own time and activities efficiently. The phrase \"start enforcing this with my friends\" indicates a desire to impose order and rules in social interactions, which is a common trait associated with the ISTJ's preference for structure and clear expectations. This reflects an awareness of social pressure that ISTJs might feel when their plans are disrupted, contrasting their need for routine and personal space. Furthermore, the intent to avoid being \"pressured into going out too often\" highlights the ISTJ's introverted nature, preferring planned rather than spontaneous social interactions.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Informal and Casual Tone**: The text contains a casual, relaxed tone with an element of humor (\"Haha I guess I'm not that invisible after all\"). This suggests a preference for informal communication, often seen in more perceiving (P) types rather than judging (J) types, who tend to be more structured.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Focus on Personal Experience**: The speaker mentions a personal change that they made (\"I changed it yesterday\") and indicates having discussed this further in another context (\"I kinda explained it here\"). This self-referential aspect indicates an introverted orientation towards personal experiences and feelings, characteristic of introverted feeling (Fi) common in ISFPs and INFPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Emphasis on Visibility and Personal Changes**: The text’s mention of invisibility and change suggests introspection about personal identity and perception from others, which aligns with the ISFP's focus on personal authenticity and self-expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Spontaneous Interaction**: The approach is more spontaneous, without detailed planning or extensive logical rationale, leaning towards the ISFP's preference for action based on current feelings and situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Here-and-Now Orientation**: The text appears to reflect a present-tense, immediate perspective with phrases indicating current status (\"I guess I'm not that invisible after all\") and recent actions (\"I changed it yesterday\"), which aligns with ISFPs who often focus on the present. \n",

ISFJs often have a fondness for physical reminders of emotional connections and experiences, as they are known for their loyalty and attachment to personal memories. Additionally, the sense of organization reflected in the collection of cards, even if it leads to a pile, aligns with the ISFJ's preference for structured and orderly environments. ISFJs are also generally private individuals, reflected here by the lack of strong emotional expression in the text, which focuses more on the behavior of accumulating cards rather than exploring the emotions behind it.\n",

The mention of \"different sides\" and how \"certain situations bring out different personalities\" shows an introspective, conceptual focus typical of intuition over concrete observation and preference for factual detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feeling (F) vs. Thinking (T):** The emphasis on personal experience, self-perception, and awareness of one's different \"sides\" suggests a feeling orientation. Being attuned to one's emotional landscape and understanding it in varied contexts implies that the author places value on emotional experience and internal states. This aligns more with a feeling type than a thinking type, which might focus more on logical consistency or external systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perceiving (P) vs. Judging (J):** The fluid nature of having \"different sides\" and adapting to \"certain situations\" without making definitive judgments about them indicates a perceiving approach. This adaptability and open-ended exploration of self-identity fit with perceivers, who tend to keep options open and explore possibilities rather than making conclusive decisions or structuring their lives in a particular way.\n",

      "1. **Directness and Decisiveness**: The text describes individuals who are \"persuasive, decisive, and direct,\" all qualities common in extraverted thinking types, particularly ENTJs. ENTJs are known for their decisiveness and ability to make tough calls without hesitation, which is suggested by the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Appreciation for Intelligence**: The mention of being \"highly intelligent\" aligns with ENTJs, who often value competence and intelligence in themselves and others. They tend to have a strong focus on accumulating knowledge and using it practically.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Persuasiveness**: The text highlights persuasiveness, a trait often associated with ENTJs. They are known for their ability to influence and lead others effectively through logical reasoning and clear communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dismissal of Charm**: The speaker dismisses \"charming\" as a quality they value, focusing instead on qualities like intelligence and decisiveness, which points towards an ENTJ preference. ENTJs often prioritize efficacy and straightforwardness over charm or tact.\n",

      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Extroversion (E):** The text begins with \"Yeah I mean Im social and love talking,\" which indicates a preference for extroversion. The individual enjoys engaging in social interactions and conversations, which are key characteristics of extroverted personalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feeling (F):** The concern for discussing one's \"unpretty side\" suggests an awareness of emotional states and a sensitivity to personal, emotional topics. This sensitivity aligns with the Feeling (F) trait, where individuals often prioritize emotions and values.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Judging (J):** The act of consciously avoiding discussions about their \"unpretty side\" may suggest a tendency for Judging, as these individuals often prefer structure and control, potentially extending to their public image and how they are perceived by others.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Intuition (N):** Although the text does not explicitly indicate a preference for Intuition over Sensing, the choice of words like \"unpretty side\" implies a focus on underlying meanings and personal insights, which may suggest an intuitive perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of extroversion, sensitivity to personal and emotional matters, and a potential leaning towards intuition and judging aligns well with the ENFJ personality type, often characterized by their social nature, empathy, and focus on personal growth and self-awareness.\n",

The speaker reveals a philosophical and somewhat detached perspective, contemplating the achievement of personal goals in a manner that suggests deep self-analysis and abstract reasoning—hallmarks of an INTP. The mention of having \"no direction\" and considering setting new goals aligns with the typical INTP approach of reconsidering and reassessing objectives rather than conforming to external pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whimsical and imaginative tone seen in \"stave off the ravenous beasts for a while\" indicates a flair for creative and unconventional thinking, often exhibited by the perceptive attitude of INTPs who value flexibility and open-ended possibilities.

      "1. **Reflective Nature**: The text demonstrates a level of introspection and reflection on past experiences, which aligns with the Introverted (I) and Intuitive (N) functions. The question about childhood and mentioning \"unprocessed childhood trauma\" suggests a focus on understanding deep, internal experiences, characteristic of introverted feeling (Fi) and intuitive thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Focus on Emotion and Meaning**: The mention of \"major anxiety issues\" and \"sets of beliefs\" related to trauma conveys a strong emphasis on emotional experiences and their impact. This aligns with the Feeling (F) function that prioritizes emotional and ethical considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Concern for Growth and Understanding**: The reference to \"unprocessed childhood trauma that needs to be worked\" indicates a desire for personal growth and healing, which is often a trait found in INFPs, who are known for seeking understanding and meaning in personal experiences.\n",

This reflects an ability to assess personal attributes in an objective manner, which is characteristic of the ISTP's focus on concrete facts and experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Skepticism and Logical Analysis**: The statement \"maybe it's not a type thing based on me pure anecdotal evidence\" indicates a skepticism towards generalizations, as well as a reliance on personal experience to reach conclusions. This critical thinking approach aligns well with the Thinking (T) preference, which involves analyzing and evaluating information logically.\n",
      "\n",

      "4. **Introverted Observation with External Logical Judgment**: The author reflects on internal experiences (Introversion) but evaluates and communicates these experiences (Thinking) in relation to an external situation (opinion about the friend's behavior).

      "\n",
      "2. **Admiration in the face of adversity**: The mention of admiration for being idealistic despite adversity (such as \"rejection, pain, illness\") indicates a focus on inner emotions and resilience.

      "\n",
      "2. **Distinction Between Work and Non-Work Situations:** The author of the text mentions being lazy outside of a paying job, highlighting a practical, realistic approach to life. This behavior aligns with the ISTP personality, which tends to be very pragmatic and may prioritize tasks they perceive as worthwhile (e.g., paid work) over others they find less rewarding (e.g., homework from school or uni).\n",

      "This excerpt suggests a preference for introversion (I), as it centers on personal feelings and an internal experience rather than discussing an external or social interaction. The narrative is introspective, centered on the writer's personal struggle and emotional response to the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming sense of panic and lack of direction point towards a preference for perceiving (P), as opposed to judging.

      "The text does not explicitly emphasize thinking vs. feeling or sensing vs. intuition, but given how the experience is described in a concrete and specific manner (detailing the exact situation and emotional response during the exam), it leans more towards sensing (S).

      "Reasoning:\n",
      "The provided text exhibits several characteristics commonly associated with the INTP personality type. Here’s a detailed analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Objective and Analytical**: The statement presents an objective view on both intuitive and sensing types by acknowledging that there is a spectrum of personalities within both groups from \"annoying\" and \"insufferable\" to \"okay\" and \"great.\" This reflects a detached, analytical perspective typical of Thinking (T) types, who prioritize objective logic over personal emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Neutrally Evaluative Language**: Instead of offering a highly emotional or subjective opinion, the language remains neutral and evaluative. This corresponds with the INTP's tendency to approach the world with curiosity and impartiality, using analysis to understand differences among people.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lack of Personal Bias**: There is no judgment or clear preference shown for one type over the other in a manner extroverted Feeling (Fe) types might show by championing harmony. Instead, the text objectively lists categories of behavior across both groups. INTPs tend to avoid heavy-handed emotional language unless it is logical to interject it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pattern Recognition and Open-Mindedness**: Recognizing that \"some are annoying, some are insufferable, but most are okay, a few are even great\" indicates a broad-minded acknowledgment that there is variety and complexity in behavior. This is characteristic of Introverted Intuition (Ni) or Extraverted Intuition (Ne), which often leads to considering multiple outcomes or possibilities, commonly found in INTP descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Component of Uncertainty**: The language reflects some uncertainty or variability (\"some,\" \"most,\" \"few\"), which is a hallmark of the INTP's dominant function, Introverted Thinking (Ti), tempered by their auxiliary Extraverted Intuition (Ne), allowing them to embrace complexity and ambiguity without needing to settle on a fixed position.\n",

Instead, the statement reflects a more intuitive approach, typical of Intuitive (N) types, who often prefer conceptual understanding over step-by-step processes.\n",

      "2. **Indifference and Reserved Nature:** The statement \"I'm indifferent about tons of stuff and I most definitely don't wear my opinions on my sleeve\" suggests a more reserved and detached approach to sharing personal views and emotions.

      "\n",
      "3. **Interest in Discussion as Secondary:** While the text mentions that discussions can be \"entertaining and educational,\" it states that they are \"not really my goal or interest.\" This suggests that while the person is open to exploring ideas and discussions, they do so as a secondary interest rather than a primary motivation. This aligns with the auxiliary Extraverted Sensing (Se) function in ISTPs, which can find engagement in immediate, sensory experiences and discussions but not as a primary goal.\n",

      "1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)**:\n",
      "   - The text suggests someone who feels the need to \"go out and do shit\" to alleviate the negative effects of overthinking, which could point towards an extraverted preference. Extraverts often feel energized and distract themselves by engaging in the external world and social activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)**:\n",
      "   - The mention of \"do shit\" implies a focus on concrete activities and taking action rather than dwelling on abstract thoughts or possibilities. This language suggests a sensing preference, which is often associated with being grounded in the present and taking immediate, tangible actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)**:\n",
      "   - The text lacks any explicit emotional language or concern for interpersonal harmony, which might suggest a thinking preference. The pragmatic decision to \"go out\" when overthinking implies a logical approach to managing feelings: identifying a problem (overthinking) and finding a solution (going out).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Perceiving (P) vs. Judging (J)**:\n",
      "   - The casual nature of the phrase \"do shit\" suggests a spontaneous and adaptable approach typical of perceiving types. The quick transition from overthinking to action reflects a preference for flexibility and keeping options open, in line with perceiving types who often seek hands-on engagement with the world around them.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Intuition (N)**: The focus on exploration and discovery indicates a preference for seeing possibilities and future potential rather than sticking to concrete realities. The mention of exploring \"earth for myself\" and then \"space\" points to an interest in abstract possibilities and an imaginative outlook.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The text provided reflects several characteristics that align with the INFP personality type. Here's a detailed analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Abstract Thinking**: The mention of \"abstract essence\" indicates a preference for abstract and conceptual thinking, which is typical of Intuitive (N) types rather than Sensing (S) types who are more grounded in concrete reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Individual Interpretation**: The question \"what does it mean to you\" suggests a strong focus on personal interpretation and individual meaning, a hallmark of the Introverted Feeling (Fi) function which is dominant in INFPs. Fi users often seek personal, subjective understanding rather than relying solely on external consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interest in Self-Improvement and Inner Experience**: The discussion about modifying temperament through kundalini yoga shows an interest in personal growth and self-improvement. INFPs are known for their deep focus on self-exploration and improving their inner lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Energetic States and Inner World**: There's an acknowledgment that one's energy levels are related to internal processes, like breathing patterns. This indicates an awareness of internal states and processes, again aligning with the INFP's emphasis on introspection and internal feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of External Structure**: The text lacks a structured, logical argument or clear practical advice, suggesting a preference for perceiving (P) over judging (J). INFPs tend to be more open-ended and flexible in their thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the combination of abstract thinking, personal exploration, and the introspective nature of the text aligns well with the INFP personality type.\n",

      "1. **Emotional Sensitivity and Introspection**: The text suggests an awareness of emotional outcomes (\"the worst result is she says no and we never talk again\") and how it perturbs interpersonal connections. Such reflections are characteristic of individuals who are introspective and emotionally sensitive, common traits in ISFPs who often prioritize personal values and feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Move On Mentality**: The acceptance of potential rejection and the ability to move on with a sense of resilience (\"you’re right I will move on\") indicates a capacity for adaptability and living in the moment. ISFPs are typically present-focused and adaptable, often seeking to manage personal well-being and emotional balance, aligning with the notion of accepting change and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Focus on Personal Relationships**: The emphasis on the potential loss of communication suggests the importance placed on personal relationships. ISFPs value close personal connections and are deeply concerned with the impact of their actions and decisions on these relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Introverted Feeling Orientation**: ISFPs have a dominant function called Introverted Feeling (Fi), which centers on inner value systems and personal feelings. The text exhibits an understanding of an internal emotional process and a focus on how interpersonal dynamics affect personal well-being, which aligns with an Fi-dominant orientation. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Pragmatism**: The individual mentions being very pragmatic, which is a trait commonly associated with ISTP types. ISTPs often prefer practical and realistic approaches, focusing on what works efficiently in real-world scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sensing and Intuition about Logical Errors**: The mention of feeling in one's \"gut\" when someone has made a logical error without having to explicitly think about it indicates a strong use of Introverted Thinking (Ti) combined with Extraverted Sensing (Se). ISTPs are known for their ability to process information internally through their dominant Ti function, which allows them to assess situations and identify errors efficiently. The \"gut\" feeling relates to Se, which gives them a quick and instinctive reaction to the present environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Processing**: The emphasis on logical errors aligns with the thinking (T) aspect of ISTPs. They are naturally inclined towards noticing inconsistencies and inefficiencies, often without requiring a detailed thought process, largely due to their analytical nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Introverted Nature**: While the text doesn’t explicitly describe introversion, the inward focus on “feeling in my gut” rather than external validation suggests an introverted perspective, which is typical of ISTP individuals who rely on their internal judgment rather than seeking external feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conjunction with these points, ISTPs are also known for their independence and ability to quickly adapt to their surroundings, using their Se function to navigate the physical world effectively.

      "3. **Subject Matter and Style:** The text is personal, subjective, and concise. It doesn't dig deeply into analytical or logical explanations, which might be expected from a Thinking type.

      "2. **Judging Preference (J vs. P):**\n",
      "   - The writer has a clear preference for print in everyday writing and only uses cursive when required.

      "\n",
      "2. **Sensation and Experience Focus**: ISTPs have a dominant function of Introverted Thinking (Ti) supported by Extraverted Sensing (Se).

ISTPs often engage with the physical world and have an appreciation for tangible, hands-on activities.\n",

      "4. **Adaptability**: By cutting off the sentence with \"uh nvm,\" the speaker implies adaptability and the ability to move on quickly, a trait often associated with the perceiving preference of ISTPs.

      "Reasoning: The text reflects a quick decision-making process, which is indicative of a preference for Sensing (S) and Thinking (T). The individual quickly assesses whether they want to continue listening to a song within 5-10 seconds, showcasing an inclination towards evaluating sensory experience and making a logical decision. ISTPs are known for their hands-on approach to the world, and their dominant function, Introverted Thinking (Ti), allows them to make rapid assessments based on logical analysis. Additionally, the auxiliary function, Extraverted Sensing (Se), supports an ISTP's ability to engage with the present moment and make quick judgments based on immediate sensory input, as seen in the quick decision regarding the song. The concise nature of the statement also aligns with the more reserved communication style typically associated with introverted types like ISTP.\n",

      "2. **Focus on Personal Experience**: The speaker is sharing an observation about their own behavior, indicating a focus on personal experience and actions, which is typical of introverted sensing (Si) in ISTPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Awareness of Impact on Others**: The speaker mentions that their behavior annoys some of the ladies they talk to, suggesting a recognition of how their actions affect others. This fits with ISTP's auxiliary extroverted thinking (Te), which considers practical impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Lack of Emotional Elaboration**: While the speaker acknowledges that their behavior annoys others, they don't delve into emotional analysis or introspection, which aligns with the ISTP's tendency to be more practical and less focused on emotional processing.\n",

      "5. **Introverted Sensing (Si)**: The observation about a recurring pattern in behavior (\"Yeah I notice I do it often\") aligns with the Si function, which is about noticing patterns in personal experiences.\n",

      "1. **Introversion (I):** The text suggests a focus on inner thoughts and emotions rather than external actions or interactions. The individual reflects on their tendency not to trust people, which is more characteristic of introverts who may internalize trust issues rather than openly sharing or discussing them with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Intuition (N):** The use of abstract thinking is evident in the question about whether a specific event led to their cautious nature. This suggests a focus on understanding the underlying reasons and patterns (a characteristic of intuitive types) rather than just describing surface-level details.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thinking (T):** The text is quite straightforward and matter-of-fact, stating, \"I don't trust people at all,\" with little to no emotional cushioning or sentimentality. This directness and unemotional assessment indicate a thinking preference, prioritizing logical reasoning over emotional considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Judging (J):** The language indicates a definitive conclusion about their trust in people (\"I don’t trust people at all\"), reflecting a judging type's preference for structure, decisiveness, and clear conclusions.\n",

      "The combination of these traits suggests an INTJ type, characterized by an inner world of logic, skepticism, and strategic planning.
