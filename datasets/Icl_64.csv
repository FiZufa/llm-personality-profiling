INTJ,Yes and due to it being shapes and objects that means our process of analyzing is not so much bound by languages
INTP,Also a logical fallacy Just because celebrities think something or believe something does not make it true
ENTJ,i dont know if its a just a rant or you actually want to do something about it most people just want to rant
ENTP,Very well could also be a sign of immaturity or an ego thats been allowed to grow unchecked
INFJ,Thank you Youre right theres nothing to miss out on with a friendship If thats what comes of this or even if it doesnt it was nice knowing them
INFP,well ill just delete this post because apparently it is not even a little bit relevant i thought this conversation was going to go a completely different direction
ENFJ,i have dreams of tornadoes a lot a lot of dreams of being away on business with old coworkers and family
ENFP,cannot keep count of those those moments are like a time bomb ticks for me i have anxiety
ISTJ,Ive really got to start enforcing this with my friends otherwise Im pressured into going out too often
ISFJ,Haha I guess Im not that invisible after all I changed it yesterday and I kinda explained it here
ESTJ,so if i understand what youve said the passively established boundaries set by parallel play style interactions are viewed as less mature than the act of actively setting boundaries
ESFJ,i keep finding birthday cards tucked away in random places and instead of throwing them out the pile just grows if i actually get given them nowadays

ISFP,i agree with this entirely my friends say i have different sides to me not like bipolar sides but certain situations bring out different personalities
ESTP,i dont think they are charming sorry just no they are usually in most cases highly intelligent persuasive decisive and direct which i think many can appreciate the value in those
ESFP,Yeah I mean Im social and love talking but when it comes to talking about myself I will do almost everything to keep from discussing my unpretty side
INTJ,You know thats what I was just thinking Oh shit maybe I already won I accomplished my goals that Id set for this age Thats why I have no direction Maybe I just need new goals Or I could just sit here and stave off the ravenous beasts for a while
INTP,it may sound odd me asking but what was your childhood like major anxiety issues as well as a number of other sets of beliefs often to stem from unprocessed childhood trauma that needs to be worked
ENTJ,This so much I have 2 businesses and I always get shitass lazy interns or employees who call in once a week or are late sit around no ambition Just so disgusting Really gets on my nerves
ENTP,It will be difficult Ill probably consume way to much coffee at first Might fail but its definitely worth a try
INFJ,LOL I am overweight but I carry my weight well and I have decent strengthstamina So maybe its not a type thing based on me pure anecdotal evidence That aside your friend doesnt sound very pleasant to be around
INFP,i agree i feel that maturity has a lot to do with the personal development and growth of our inner selves this helps us understand ourselves better make better choices and be able to relate
ENFJ,more than possible skills are things you are constantly learning and practising and socialising is no different for most of the time i was growing up im only 20 now mind i was horrendous

ISFP,my inability to follow directions for building assembling etc is actually getting more embarrassing as i get older its almost like i just shut down when when i see that kind of stuff
ESTP,Im indifferent about tons of stuff and I most definitely dont wear my opinions on my sleeve I like to remain factual and objective but going off into a discussion can be entertaining and educational but not really my goal or interest
ESFP,i did the bottle flipping with a group of friends at school and my bottle actually landed without falling all my friends were like oohhhhhhh
ENFJ,Youre very welcome Im happy you found it mostly true and I appreciate your feedback on the parts I need to do more research
ENFJ,thats mandatory the problem is if you dont actually define or redefine shit and just go halfway through and give up its just insane push through
ENFP,i used to be like that when i was younger but now it choose when to show it
ENFP,very much so I live for the future Am deeply unhappy about my current life and am constantly planning a future where I have everything I want
ENTJ,i can partially conclude since the sample is not big enough that the assumptions were wrong nt women arent more seductive and charming than other types
ENTJ,one single thread can be quite enough for the ntp matters in question just rename it or create a new one and youll get your result simple as that

ESTJ,Well we find common ground But I dont think that rioting and property destruction is going to solve the problem
ESTP,Maybe hes simply not ready to get too close to you yet I dont think joking around to make you laugh is necessarily a sign of a special treat from him
